# MiniCPM51BModel: Docker on a deployment device (ZimaOS server)

Run the service on a separate always-on box (default `user@your-server.local`, folder
`/media/ZimaOS-HD/Apps/MiniCPM51BModel`). It is a self-contained compose stack (`ollama`, `minicpm_pull`, `minicpm`,
`minicpm_lb`) with no Citadel dependency.

## Requirements on the box
- Docker + Compose v2, ssh access as a normal user (root over ssh is refused).
- Internet on the first start (model pull, about 1 GB). Disk for the `ollama` volume.

## 1. Publish the code (from your PC)
Run `MiniCPM51BModel\tools\deploy.bat`:

| Option | Does |
|---|---|
| 1 | Publish code to the `live` branch |
| 2 | Copy your `.env` to the server (one ssh/tar session) |
| 3 | Both |
| 4, 5 | Dry runs |
| 6 | chown helper if option 2 says `Permission denied` |

Override the target with `DEPLOY_HOST`, `DEPLOY_DIR`, `DEPLOY_WEB_PORT`. Commit `main` first: publish reads committed
`main`. The `live` branch holds only Dockerfile, compose, nginx.conf, pyproject, src, web and README.

## 2. First-time setup on the box
```bash
mkdir -p /media/ZimaOS-HD/Apps
git clone -b live <your-repo-url> /media/ZimaOS-HD/Apps/MiniCPM51BModel
cd /media/ZimaOS-HD/Apps/MiniCPM51BModel
```
`.env` (deploy option 2 copies yours, or `cp .env.example .env`):
- `MINICPM_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: set a real one.
- `MINICPM_NUM_THREAD`: the real core count of the box.
- `MINICPM_REPLICAS=1`, `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=2` are fine to start.

## 3. Start
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
curl http://127.0.0.1:9130/health
```
`minicpm_pull` ends as `Exited (0)` after downloading the model.

## 4. Let callers reach it
`MINICPM_PORT` (9130) is published on all interfaces, so other devices use `http://<box-ip>:9130`.
1. Open `http://<box-ip>:9130/admin/`, log in, create one token per calling project.
2. Callers send it as `X-Internal-Token`.
3. A stack on the same box uses `http://host.docker.internal:9130`, or joins the `minicpm` network from its own
   compose file (`external: true`) and calls `http://minicpm_lb:9130`. The service never references its callers.
4. Firewall the port if the LAN should not reach it, and never expose it to the internet.

## Updating
```bash
cd /media/ZimaOS-HD/Apps/MiniCPM51BModel
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose restart minicpm_lb
```
The model and tokens volumes survive rebuilds.

## Problems
| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Permission denied on push | deploy.bat option 6. |
| `.env` seems missing | Hidden dotfile: `ls -la`. |
| `/health` `ready: false` | Model not pulled: `docker compose logs minicpm_pull`, then `docker compose up -d`. |
| Slow or 504 | Lower `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL`, set `MINICPM_NUM_THREAD` to real cores. |
| nginx 502 after update or scaling | `docker compose restart minicpm_lb`. |
